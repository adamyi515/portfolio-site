# Portfolio website

Job huntin' is tough. And building a portfolio website to showcase what you can do is critical to get that interview with a potential
client. This is the source code, from scartch, on how I built my personal website. For the time being, I'll be using the good ole
HTML, CSS (BEM methodology), JavaScript and React library to create a simple site. I've already deployed a couple of mini projects that uses
React, Redux and Context API onto Netlify. This website is also deployed to Netlify. Should invest into a DNS and make this official.

## Tools used to create the website (as of Feb. 2022)

1. React hooks
2. Context API or Redux? (Will decide when I further expand this application)
3. React router dom (v. 6+)
4. Database? (Looking to see if I can utilize MongoDB)
5. Blog functionality (Need database to do this)
6. CSS modules
